#LSB in Python
This pack is used for solving the LSB steganography problem. By using python to hide the text into the image and decode it.

This pack contains two main python files:
-LSB_encode.py
-LSB_decode.py

To use it , plese confirm the python version at least 3, and I suggest 3.8.5. Also please install the packages in requirement.txt . 

The path in the python files are all the absolute path, so you are better to use it too. Please change your file's absolute path before running the python script.

The script doesn't limit the text's length, so if your text is very long, the image will not be able to hide it.
